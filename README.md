# Assignment: The Drum Machine

_Well met!_

Your task is to build a drum machine, using the included soundfile in this repo, in the `/sounds` folder.

You can structure and style the drum machine however you please, but it should have the following functionality:

- Each individual drum should be represented by a button or image that should play the sound when clicked
- Each individual drum should have an associated keyboard shortcut that also plays the sound. The associated shortcut should be displayed on the page.

This will be a project that can look good in your portfolio, so I suggest putting some effort into the styling. But in the scope of the assignment, any amount of styling is ok as long as it works.

Feel free to use the drum machine I made in the lecture as _inspiration_, but don't hand in a copy. Make the solution your own.

Good luck & Have fun! ü•Å
